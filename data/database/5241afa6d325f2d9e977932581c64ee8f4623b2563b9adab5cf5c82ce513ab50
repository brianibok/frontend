The makers say they’re going for a different approach. “We won’t be trying to find new Sids or Kenneths,” Sothcott says. “We’re looking to create a whole new ensemble of brilliant British comedic actors. No stunt casting. No big American stars. This will be British film at its best, as the truly remarkable heritage deserves.”</p> <p><strong>Surely what the Carry On heritage deserves is that they just grind out more tat to make some money, like in the old days? </strong>Well, that’s another opinion.</p> <p><strong>Besides, will boob gags and bum-pinching really still be popular in post-Yewtree Britain? </strong>That’s probably a no. But the new films will be updates, apparently, rather than remakes. “We intend to be sympathetic to the heritage,” says Dawson, “whilst being unafraid to modernise the franchise for a whole new audience.” It might work if they write scripts that puncture political correctness instead of prudery, as long as it stays light and not too shocking.</p> <p><strong>It seems hard.

Eastbourne.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Seasidey.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> About 150 years old.</p> <p><strong>Like most of its residents, eh? Get it? Because people move there when they retire and …</strong> Yes, I understand the joke. But it’s rather out of date. Like many coastal towns in the south, Eastbourne has been getting younger and groovier. The band <a href=\"http://www.toploaderofficial.com/\">Toploader</a> were formed there.</p> <p><strong>Um, yes. You can’t get much groovier than that. I suppose I can see why young people might want to live where they can frolic on the beach, where they and their eventual children can breathe the fresh sea air.</strong> Yeah. Um. Except, actually, that’s out of date as well. Eastbourne has <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/seaside-towns-clean-image-bites-the-dust-fk7n9w2cs\">some of the worst air pollution in the country</a>.</p> <p><strong>What? How? Half of it is sea.</strong> I know. It’s all rather embarrassing, especially as the cover of <a href=\"http://www.visiteastbourne.com/?AskRedirect=true\">this year’s Visit Eastbourne brochure</a> reads: “Breathe it in.”</p> <p><strong>So, what’s going on? </strong>Well, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/eastbourne-a-surprise-name-among-uks-most-polluted-towns-and-cities\">according to the World Health Organisation</a>, among all the towns in the UK, Eastbourne has the third-highest levels of very small particulates in the air, and the seventh-highest of slightly bigger ones. It’s at least as bad as London, and fractionally worse than Scunthorpe, which is a big steel town. Only Glasgow is decidedly smoggier.</p> <p><strong>Worse than Scunthorpe! What’s going on in Eastbourne? Do Toploader constantly ride around in a coal-fired steamer?</strong> They may do. I haven’t heard much about them lately. But no, that isn’t the problem.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t Eastbourne pier burn down? </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/30/eastbourne-pier-centrepiece-building-fire\">Part of it did, yes</a>, but that was two years ago, so the smoke has probably dispersed by now. The problem is other people.</p> <p><strong>Isn’t it always! I keep saying that, but they don’t listen.</strong> Yeah, well, in Eastbourne’s case, it’s true. There’s no heavy industry in the town, and only about 100,000 people, but they happen to be in just the wrong place, where wisps of smog drift over from London and from the continent.</p> <p><strong>Brexit! Let’s do a Brexit!</strong> That won’t fix the problem, I’m afraid. Smog doesn’t need a passport. Besides, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/04/eu-car-pollution-laws-have-improved-uks-air-quality-say-carmakers\">EU air pollution laws</a> have been forcing our reluctant governments to tackle the problem (a bit).</p> <p><strong>Still, at least Eastbourne is the sunniest town in Britain.</strong> Unless Hastings is. Which it is, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/9022770/Eastbourne-the-sunniest-Hastings-wont-be-outshone.html\">according to Hastings</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Let’s attack France and make it cut its pollution!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “With special low-emission battleships!”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\"

Possibly.</p> <p><strong>What? How dare you! I pay thousands of pounds a year for my first-class ticket!</strong> OK. The government is proposing a reduction in the space set aside for first-class travel, in order to beat the scourge of overcrowding on busy rail routes.</p> <p><strong>But I love travelling first class.</strong> Of course you do. That’s because you’re a snooty one-percenter who wouldn’t be seen dead slumming it with the rest of the population. I bet you buy Speedy Boarding when you fly easyJet too, don’t you?</p> <p><strong>What’s an easyJet? </strong>Never mind … Look, a west coast mainline <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/521932/icwc-consultation-english.pdf\">consultation document</a> has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/first-class-allocation-on-trains-could-be-reduced-to-ease-overcrowding\">suggested a change in the balance of first- and standard-class coaches</a>, because overcrowding causes untold misery for millions of passengers a year. It’s a good idea.</p> <p><strong>Please explain overcrowding. </strong>Fine. People who buy standard-class tickets between, say, London and Manchester, regularly have to stand for the entire two-and-a-quarter-hour trip, which seems a bit off since a peak-time single ticket costs £166.</p> <p><strong>That’s their problem, not mine.</strong> But wouldn’t it be nice to know that you were giving up a sliver of luxury in order to help your fellow man?</p> <p><strong>No! That sounds terrible! I cloister myself away from that rabble for a reason.</strong> I don’t think that matters. A new operator will run the west cost mainline from 2018, and the franchise will probably be given to whoever takes up the government’s suggestion.</p> <p><strong>But if they’re getting rid of first class, does that mean … </strong>Yes, it does. It means we’re all either getting promoted to first-class passengers, or you’re getting a demotion.</p> <p><strong>This cannot be allowed to happen. I’m better than you people.</strong> Oh, whatever. I’ll see you sitting on the floor in a footwell next to a malfunctioning toilet on the 7:42 to Manchester.</p> <p><strong>No! I must stop this, however I can.</strong> Have you thought about full-stop tweeting a rail operator in anger, like all the other frustrated commuters do?</p> <p><strong>Well, no, I’m not a monster. </strong>Thank God for that.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Finally, British rail travel becomes a meritocracy.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“An expensive, uncomfortable, unreliable meritocracy that will inevitably drive us all to our graves.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7aef50a806005bf0f3e7102546f13d01910d2227\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aef50a806005bf0f3e7102546f13d01910d2227/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Class wars ...

</strong>Sheryl Sandberg</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 46</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The Acceptable Face of Facebook.</p> <p><strong>Facebook’s chief operating officer? Why is she in the news? Zuckerberg’s not about to upload our consciousnesses into the ether because we forgot to tweak the privacy settings to say DON’T, MARK, DON’T, is he? </strong>No.</p> <p><strong>I am vastly relieved. What is it, then? </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/03/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-death-david-goldberg\">recently widowed</a> Sandberg has posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10156819553860177\">long essay on FB</a> about what she has learned about life without a partner.</p> <p><strong>Which is? </strong>That it’s harder. Much harder. Harder than she realised when she wrote her bestseller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/13/lean-in-sheryl-sandberg-review\">Lean In</a>, which advised women on how to make it to the top in business. It is kind of an apology for not appreciating how hard single mothers and other women have it. “Before, I did not quite get it. I did not really get how hard it is to succeed at work when you are overwhelmed at home,” she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/dave-was-my-rock-sheryl-sandbergs-beautiful-tribute-to-the-husband-she-lost\">Sheryl Sandberg's moving tribute to the husband who died: 'Dave was my rock'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Really? That’s nice. That’s something you don’t hear very often. </strong>She goes on to say that she now thinks that the emphasis Lean In put on self-confidence, dedication and cultivating personal ambition rather than systemic, institutional change was wrong – that individual efforts can only ever be a partial solution.</p> <p><strong>Whoa – that’s quite, y’know, radical for a corporate bod. </strong>Indeed. And to evolve your position publicly is almost equally so.</p> <p><strong>It takes courage to do this. To say that their thinking has changed, to admit they might have been mistaken or ignorant to begin with … I do not see many people doing this, in public or private life. </strong>Me neither. Sandberg ended her post with a plea to protect working mothers, saying that America needs to “rethink our public and corporate workforce policies” and “understand that it takes a community to raise children and that so many of our single mothers need and deserve a much more supportive community than we give them.” The very end is a vow “to support them, every day”.</p> <p><strong>I cannot tell you how much I admire this. Out of sorrow, empathy. Looking outwards instead of retreating into grief. This is good. I guess she’s already being hounded for practical details of how FB is going to do this, but let us just leave it there for now, shall we? </strong>Let’s.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Go, girl. Lean even further in.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> Anything else. Just for a bit.</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0086b7081da37a5581f6aa29b1d5a5cafe9527b\"> <img

We’re no longer lumping pensioners together. Instead, we’re <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/08/diamond-days-smartie-senior-security-or-vintage-value---which-ty/\">dividing them into four distinct demographic categories</a>, each with its own name.</p> <p><strong>What four categories?</strong> Well, there are the Smarties (senior market town retirees) – old people who retire to market towns, instead of the traditional seaside.</p> <p><strong>I’m going to take your word for it that this is a thing. </strong>Then there are Diamond Days (affluent, mortgage-free suburbanites), Senior Security (well-off but risk-averse), and the Vintage Value (not so well-off).</p> <p><strong>Those aren’t very good names.</strong> Don’t blame me, blame the credit-checking company Experian, in whose report these demographics are profiled.</p> <p><strong>I disagree with Experian’s patronising assessment of seniors. Not to mention their patronising assessment of my creditworthiness.</strong> I’m afraid this is only the latest attempt to demolish broad stereotypes of the elderly, and replace them with slightly more specific stereotypes with cute names.</p> <p><strong>What were some of the others? </strong>You will recall <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/07/30/ageing-over-65s-prefer-grey-pantner-tag-pensioner_n_1718298.html\">Grey Panthers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian_jobs_and_money/story/0,3605,991464,00.html\">Silver Surfers</a>. In the US, they are wont to <a href=\"http://www.esri.com/library/brochures/pdfs/senior-demographics.pdf\">divide pensioners</a> into the Elders (retirees living in senior accommodation), Silver and Gold (old and wealthy) and Rustbelt Retirees (old couples who stay put in industrial cities).</p> <p><strong>Pensioners can’t enjoy being stereotyped in this fashion, can they? </strong>Probably not, but they don’t really like being called “pensioners”, either. Or “elderly”. A 2012 survey found that their top pick was “senior citizen”.</p> <p><strong>Well that’s that. Senior citizen it is. </strong>Except it doesn’t really address the increasing demographic spread as people live longer.</p> <p><strong>So, we need to distinguish between the medium old, the well old and the bare old? </strong>Exactly. A couple of years ago the term “Real Senior” was introduced to specify the 85+ bracket.</p> <p><strong>That’s not just terrible, it actually bespeaks of prejudice against the not-very-old. Who came up with that? </strong>A bunch of old people - but to be fair to them, they were choosing from a list that included the Very Oldies, the Long Lived, Wisdom Warriors and the Venerables.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Of course we need terms that convey the range of diversity among the over-65s. But we also need some kind of government vetting procedure for the names.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Don’t forget the Solbios – Seniors Outside Lidl Before It Opens.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99df84f9c7e08e36338fa47122cbede236c89f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99df84f9c7e08e36338fa47122cbede236c89f1a/0_353_5435_3262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An affluent, older, mortgage-free suburbanite on holiday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An affluent, older, mortgage-free suburbanite on holiday – aka a ‘Diamond Days’ in marketing speak</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sofie Delauw/Getty Images/Cultura RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4j253","wordcount":"398","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/99df84f9c7e08e36338fa47122cbede236c89f1a/0_353_5435_3262/500.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"57309ee5e4b0af04cb8897a4","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2016-05-14T15:28:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The latest nicknames for older demographics include ‘smarties’ (senior market town retirees), ‘diamond days’ and ‘vintage values’.

He has been spotted behind the wheel of a brand-new Mercedes C-Class (which cost upwards of £29,000), with what appears to be a driving instructor in the passenger seat.</p> <p><strong>Do his parents know that most instructors come with their own cars? </strong>Probably, but they have their brand to think of: Brand Beckham.</p> <p><strong>Shiny, sleek, unbesmirched by BSM’s intrusive logo? </strong>Nor, it would seem, by L-plates. The Merc had a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3574751/Brooklyn-Beckham-puts-L-plates-plush-37k-car-illegally-displaying-just-one.html\">discreet L on the back</a>, but not on the front.</p> <p><strong>Of course not. A Mercedes C-Class with an L-plate slapped on the bonnet? How uncool would that look? </strong>Way uncool, but without it one faces a £60 penalty.</p> <p><strong>£29,000 for the car, plus £60 for the fine – it all adds up. </strong>Yes, it does. According to <a href=\"http://www.gocompare.com/\">GoCompare</a>, insuring a car that expensive for a kid that young would cost £5,326 a year.</p> <p><strong>Being spoiled, turning a steering wheel – is there no end to young Brooklyn’s talents? </strong>He’s also a professional fashion photographer.</p> <p><strong>Is he now?</strong> Technically, yes. He was selected to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/30/sheer-nepotism-brooklyn-beckham-burberry-shoot-angers-photographers\">shoot Burberry’s most recent fragrance campaign earlier this year</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why would a top fashion house hire an inexperienced 17-year-old boy to photograph one of its major campaigns? </strong>Maybe he owns a really posh camera. Or it could be because he’s celebrity royalty and has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brooklynbeckham/?hl=en\">6.8 million Instagram followers</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wow. I’ll bet that’s more than the number of people who watched the Queen’s Christmas speech. </strong>An odd comparison, but let me just check that for you … No, you’re wrong there – <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/12069640/Downton-Abbey-tops-Christmas-Day-TV-ratings.html\">7.5 million people watched the Queen’s speech</a> last Christmas.</p> <p><strong>But they would probably be all old, and not very interested in Burberry’s hip new fragrances. Not that Burberry could advertise on the BBC anyway. </strong>As I said, an odd comparison.</p> <p><strong>I suppose the Queen could have a bottle of perfume on her desk, but she doesn’t seem like the type to go in for product placement. </strong>No. Hiring the children of famous people as fashion photographers is almost certainly the future of advertising.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Mirror, pout, click, post.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"343cf36633badb81a91ca603b544f672e8ac2f17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/343cf36633badb81a91ca603b544f672e8ac2f17/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To cool for driving school ...

Labrador.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Exactly 100, if we go by when the breed club was formed in the UK, although they are at least a century older than that.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Barrel chest, floppy ears, pleading eyes. Typically black, yellow or chocolate-coloured. Like to hunt, swim and play with toilet rolls.</p> <p><strong>Misnomer:</strong> Labradors don’t come from the Canadian province of Labrador. They come from the Canadian island of Newfoundland – part of the same province – and are derived from the St John’s water dog.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/04/owners-must-take-the-lead-on-canine-obesity\">Owners must take the lead on canine obesity | Brief letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Most popular dogs in the world, aren’t they?</strong> They are indeed. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_Retriever\">More than twice as popular as any other breed in the UK and the US</a>.</p> <p><strong>And the cleverest?</strong> Depends how you look at it.

Those most disposed to eat are also the ones that learn to perform tasks fastest, because food is used as an incentive.</p> <p><strong>Your grasp of the science seems a bit vague.</strong> It’s something to do with a bit of the POMC gene having been deleted.</p> <p><strong>Why did the POMC gene get deleted?</strong> Possibly because among St John’s water dogs – which were used to retrieve nets, ropes and fish from the sea – eating enormous amounts conferred a genetic advantage. Survival of the fattest.</p> <p><strong>So, obesity is good for you?</strong> Only if you spend your life retrieving nets in freezing seas.</p> <p><strong>Three famous labradors:</strong> Injured serviceman <a href=\"http://houndsforheroes.com/what-we-do/meet-the-team/allen-parton/\">Allen Parton’s assistance dog Endal</a>, whose party trick was to operate a cash machine. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidblunkett\">David Blunkett</a>’s guide dog Lucy, whose political astuteness was so great she once <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/295087.stm\">threw up in the House of Commons</a> during a speech by David Willetts. <a href=\"http://www.moggies.co.uk/articles/wtc_hero.html\">Omar Riviera’s guide dog Dorado</a>, who was with his owner on the 71st floor of the north tower at the World Trade Center on 9/11.

Rien de rien.</em></p> <p><strong>Stop it. Tell me. </strong>A 44-year-old Frenchman, Frédéric Desnard, is taking his former employers – a perfume company – to a tribunal because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/02/frenchman-takes-former-employer-to-tribunal-over-tedious-job\">he claims they gave him “bore-out”</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Qu’est-ce que c’est que ça</em> when it’s at home? </strong>It is when you are “<em>mise en placard</em>” – put in a cupboard, metaphorically, given only menial tasks and deprived of all meaningful responsibility at work. Desnard says his bosses at Interparfums did this to him for four years and gave him bore-out. Like burnout, he says, but less interesting.</p> <p><strong>Unless Emmanuelle Béart and Daniel Auteuil have a baby and call it Hermes Croissant, this is the Frenchest thing there will ever be. This guy is having an existential crisis about being bored at work?</strong> He says it was “a descent into hell”. He was ashamed of being paid for doing nothing.</p> <p><strong>Why didn’t he just move to England and pride himself on it instead? He could have become a god among disaffected men.</strong> Have you no pride?</p> <p><strong>No. But I have Twitter. I have a Facebook account that helps me while away the hours of my understimulating employment. I can take 35 minutes to make a single cup of tea; 45 for a trip to the loo. If I’ve had Weetabix for breakfast, the day’s gone before I know it.</strong> I think Monsieur Desnard asks a little more out of life.</p> <p><strong>He should have asked for a little more from his colleagues. Do they not gossip in France? Think of all the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/13/naughty-pause-british-affairs-after-work\"><strong><em>cinq à sept</em></strong></a><strong> they’ve got to talk about!</strong> I don’t know. Probably not in the same way we do. They probably exchange small slices of high-quality stuff instead of indulging in massive, vulgar gabfests like we do. As with gateaux, so with gossip.</p> <p><strong>That won’t fill the unforgiving days, will it? </strong><em>Non</em>.</p> <p><strong>Well, good luck to him. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I am behind on my work. </strong>Do you mean your Instagram-scrolling?</p> <p><strong>I do. </strong><em>Très bon</em>.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “A fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “But a day’s skiving for a day’s pay is even better.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fbb840aa3612e374e4786a9a9aa28f17e48ef41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fbb840aa3612e374e4786a9a9aa28f17e48ef41/0_377_5615_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bored at work … grounds for a tribunal?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bored at work … grounds for a tribunal?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PeopleImages.com/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4tzg4","wordcount":"388","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fbb840aa3612e374e4786a9a9aa28f17e48ef41/0_377_5615_3370/500.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"5728b1c0e4b02046f02ec729","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2016-05-06T14:45:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Frédéric Desnard is having an existential crisis because his job isn’t stimulating enough.
