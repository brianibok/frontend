From being the darling of the Brics, it is falling harder and faster than all the rest (if you exclude South Africa from the club). This process, triggered by a vast corruption scandal and an overreliance on income from commodities, has rekindled old and perilous political tensions within one of the world’s most unequal countries.</p> <p>And so Rio is bracing itself for a difficult southern hemisphere winter as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/27/rio-2016-olympic-games-100-days-to-go-brazil-controversy-legacy\">it prepares to host the Olympic Games in August</a>. In a desperate effort to steer the economic ship away from the rocks, the suspended president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dilma-rousseff\">Dilma Rousseff</a>, switched engines from one propelled by state largesse to a very different model driven by extreme austerity.</p> <p>As a consequence of the shift, money from Brasilia to the regions has dried up. The budgets for education, health, sanitation and transport are being slashed. The Olympics, an event that is likely to accentuate Rio’s long-term debt, is now also underfunded. Critical projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/2016-olympics-games-metro-extension-delay\">the extension of the Metro to the Olympic Village in Barra</a> to the west of the city, won’t be finished on time, giving rise to fears that the gridlock that plagues the city for five hours every day will stretch out to 16 hours.</p> <p>Still, Rio desperately needs the Olympic tourists to turn up. But the negative publicity surrounding two viruses, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zika-virus\">Zika</a> and more recently H1N1, has prompted a large number of people to cancel their trips to the Games. Drought, disease, environmental disasters, persistently high rates of homicide – sometimes people waking up in Brazil can be forgiven for thinking that they must inadvertently have insulted every single god from Brazil’s many syncretic faiths.</p> <p>But Rio is still Rio. It remains a hugely vibrant, fascinating, beautiful and fun city. As <a href=\"http://www.luizeduardosoares.com/\">Luiz Eduardo Soares</a> points out in the introduction to <em>Rio de Janeiro</em>, the city that “inhabits the global imagination is one big cliche”. Yet he also appreciates that it would be wrong to deny the existence of many of the qualities that make up the cliche. You can still find sex, sea and samba in Rio if you want to – though, Soares argues, these are the least interesting aspects of the place.</p> <p>I was concerned when I read the Portuguese version of the book about a year ago that it would not work in English unless there was some judicious editing. In the original, Soares plunges into a story about how his political career was torn to shreds by a culture of corruption within the Workers’ Party. The tale would be readily understandable for Brazilians, although still shocking. Yet for a British audience, I thought, it assumed too much knowledge both of the local culture and of Soares’s own remarkable career as an academic, politician and very successful writer.</p> <p>It seems that Soares’s editor at Penguin, <a href=\"http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Thomas-Penn/71752643\">Thomas Penn</a>, spotted the same problem and, with a deft manoeuvre, he has solved it by shifting the order of the chapters. Editing does not always mean comprehensive rewrites or complex plot shifting. The role of the editor is most commonly defined in a pejorative sense by his or her absence, so I am very happy to highlight a successful intervention such as this one. It has had a remarkable impact on the book. Now, the first few of Soares’s nine stories introduce us gently not just to Rio’s dark underbelly that he chronicles so well, but to the author himself. The book is most illuminating when the city’s personality fuses with that of Soares.</p> <p>The nine tales are all standalone but they have a lot of connecting tissue. As a body of powerful descriptive essays, they gradually reveal the violence and corruption that underpins so much of the quotidian experience of the Cariocas, as the inhabitants of Rio are known. The fabled party culture exists both despite and because of the lurking nightmares.</p> <p>The opening chapter, “Pedra da Gávea”, anticipates that theme. It begins with the wonder Soares feels when he moves from his provincial birthplace as a young boy to Niterói, the city that lies across Guanabara Bay from Rio proper. From here he gazed longingly at the Marvellous City, dreaming of exploring it and, above all, of the day when he would first be permitted to attend a game at the Maracanã Stadium.</p> <p>In early 1964, life gets even better for him as his maternal grandfather purchases an apartment for the family in the attractive district of Laranjeiras, home to the two majestic palaces that house the governor and government of Rio State. He is woken from his excited reverie a month later by the appearance of a tank on his street with its barrel pointing at his apartment. This was the beginning of “The Day That Lasted 21 Years”, to use the title of an excellent recent documentary about the military-civilian coup of 31 March/1 April that year. It is an event that some of former president Rousseff’s supporters now invoke as comparable to current events.</p> <p>The mass violence of Chile’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet\">Augusto Pinochet</a> and of the Argentine junta in the 1970s eclipsed the nastiness of Brazilian military rule. But as Soares’s second story, “No Ordinary Woman”, demonstrates, Brazil had more than enough sadists to go around. Set largely in Rio’s torture chamber on <em>Rua Barão de Mesquita</em>, it details the appalling suffering inflicted on Dulce Pandolfi, today hailed as one of the country’s leading historians. That she lived to tell the tale is little short of a miracle. This is a hard but important read, aswe learn the peculiar techniques of violent interrogation, including the Brazilian military’s signature device, the <em>pau de arara</em> or macaw’s perch – a prisoner’s hands and legs are tied around a piece of wood, which is then hung from the ceiling, leading to excruciating pain.</p> <p><em>Rio de Janeiro: Extreme City</em> reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/06/ray-bradbury\">Ray Bradbury</a>’s science-fiction book of short stories, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/illustrated-man.html\"><em>The Illustrated Man</em></a>. As the hero shifts position or lifts a limb, he reveals another unexpected hidden aspect of life, in Soares’s case of the Carioca experience. Bent police, a brilliant economist turned major drug dealer, a hospital director who is shot for not obeying the rules of corruption and a favela gangster torn between his future and the people he protects are all portrayed with precision and elegance.</p> <p>Soares is a renaissance figure in Rio. An anthropologist who has taught at home and abroad, he is probably best known as the author of the novel that became the film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125409/elite.squad\"><em>Elite Squad</em></a>, which he also co-scripted. Alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jan/03/artsfeatures2\"><em>City of God</em></a>, the film was the most important cultural moment in shifting the perception of Rio away from the cliches. But in Brazil, he is also a politician responsible over the years for devising some of the most innovative strategies on violence and inequality. As national security adviser to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\">Luiz Inácio da Silva</a>’s first administration, he learned the hard way that the Workers’ Party was prone to the same corrupt practices as the parties of the right. It is Brazil’s misfortune that the victims – as he details – included Soares himself.</p> <p>• Misha Glenny’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/323676//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Nemesis: One Man and the Battle for Rio</em></a> is published by Bodley Head.

Empathy, humility, reparation and change,” she urged.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don’t clap it. Don’t clap it. Because then it’s that: it’s a good speech at a thing, it gets clapped. It’s <em>not </em>that. This is from the bottom of my fucking pits. It’s everything I’ve ever wanted to say and I have to say it right now, and I’m terrified, because I know you’re not meant to say it. I’m fucking terrified.</p> <p>That is what I wanted to say; I wanted to bring it into the space and encourage you to just fucking have the conversation with each other. The conversations are being had, I’m sure – I don’t mean to patronise you, I’m not here to blame you, I feel really fucking awkward and weird, but this must be said.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tempest spoke about the importance of literature, and of listening to and engaging with the world around us. “Engage with the reality, not just lip service – the reality of what this land is saying. Of what happened here. Of what continues to happen here. Talk to your children about it, talk to your friends.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/writers-festival-sheet-how-to-bluff-your-way-through-the-literary-season\">Writers' festival cheat sheet: how to bluff your way through the literary season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the second time Tempest has appeared at the Sydney writers’ festival, after a smaller tour in 2013.

We are in the middle of a barbarous time and it’s greed that’s at the root of it.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Tempest left the Sydney writers’ festival audience with a plea: “For the rest of this week I hope that you have a beautiful and important time, but just stop it – stop pretending. It’s real. This is real life … I know it sounds like I’m getting a bit hysterical – and if you are recording it don’t fucking broadcast it – I don’t care. It’s like: we can’t keep pretending that everything is going to be OK.”</p> <p><em>• Kate Tempest appears at <a href=\"http://www.swf.org.au/program/swf2016/kate-tempest-the-bricks-that-built-the-houses-186\">Sydney writers’ festival</a> on 20 and 21 May; at <a href=\"http://avidreader.com.au/events\">the Avid Reader bookshop</a> in Brisbane on 23 May; at the <a href=\"http://www.byron-bay.com/events/kate-tempest/\">Byron Theatre</a> on 24 May; and at <a href=\"http://www.wheelercentre.com/events/kate-tempest-storming-the-castle\">the Wheeler Centre</a>, Melbourne on 26 May.

Following a chain of tragic events, members of the Ambrose family are forced to leave their town and seek refuge elsewhere. What will become of them when they set forth into the unknown, leaving all comfort behind? Fleeing, they are forced to sleep on the road without shelter. Eventually they end up in an overcrowded refugee camp. The main character Amina used to be reprimanded for making up fantasies with her vivid imagination, but it is her stories about the stars that shine light during the darkest of circumstances.</p> <p>This is an extremely thought-provoking novel that expresses the importance of stories and how they have the power to give hope to those in desperate situations. I really enjoyed this book. It was truly heartwarming despite covering difficult issues such as war, dictatorship and refugees in crisis. The subject matter is rather shocking at times but this is the reality in parts of our world and it is told in a way that will not put off young readers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6a70da40fa862d5bd132628c2b1d90e1543f1917\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a70da40fa862d5bd132628c2b1d90e1543f1917/0_0_257_400/257.jpg\" alt=\"lookingatthestars\" width=\"257\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ordinarily I would not have chosen to read a book with this type of subject matter but I am glad that I did because it made me reflect on how lucky so many of us are, yet we often forget and take our good fortune for granted. Young readers will get a glimpse into the world of refugees and oppressed women in an accessible way through entering Amina’s world. I feel that I have a better understanding of other countries now, having read this novel.

ecocriticism of Augustine of Hippo and presents him as a cerebral Anglican. Lane Fox’s account is of the man, fornication and all<br />","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>These two new books on Augustine of Hippo, the towering figure of late-antique Latin theology, could not be more different, but that will hardly come as a surprise. Robin Lane Fox is an ancient historian who once wrote a book (<a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v14/n05/stephanie-west/re-reading-the-bible\" title=\"\"><em>The Unauthorised Version</em></a>, 1991) announcing his own atheism and his intention to expose the historical contradictions underlying the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. Rowan Williams retired as archbishop of Canterbury in 2012 – while in the role he repeatedly defended the rights of the religious to resist secularism. Lane Fox writes with a historian’s gift for exposing the strangeness of a different culture; Williams immerses himself in the theological subtleties of one of antiquity’s most ambitious thinkers.</p> <p>Williams’s book, a collection of revised articles (and one sermon) written for different audiences, has all the trappings of academia: sophisticated, challenging prose, German titles in the footnotes, sometimes even untranslated Latin (not all of it, I am bound to say as a classicist, reproduced perfectly). But for all that, it is less a critical study than an attempt to enlist the ancient writer as an ally for the modern theologian. For Williams, Augustine matters as the thinker who elevated doubt, questioning and self-consciousness – gathered up in the idea of “confessions”, which became the title of his most famous work – to a spiritual state. The underlying message is that if we, in our secular world, feel paralysed by the moral complexity around us, that should lead us not to postmodern relativism and ennui, but to acknowledging that our own limitations and weaknesses are what make us human, and – more importantly – that true knowledge and wisdom are dependent on our philosophical acceptance of God within the community of Christian believers.</p> <p>Indeed, Williams borrows throughout from the postmodern lexicon, with a particular fondness for metaphors drawn from language and literature. Existence is a narrative. The soul is a sign (even if, as he says, Augustine “does not quite put it like that”). The world is a “trace” (a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/11/guardianobituaries.france\" title=\"\">Derridean</a> term) of its maker. Evil has a grammar. Even God has a place in a linguistic system, as pure being, irreducible to the sign. But when he writes that “there is no finality, no ‘closure’, no settled or intrinsic meaning in the world we inhabit”, Williams is not conceding the postmodern point but countering it; for of course the meaning that shapes our lives is, in his view, precisely not of this world, and it is only once we have come to accept that indeterminacy is what defines us as humans that we can begin to accept Christ’s testimony to that deeper truth.</p> <p>If Williams gets Augustine as an ally, Augustine in return gets Williams as an advocate, a robust defence counsel in the face of the accusations levelled at him since the 20th century. Williams has no time for ecocritics who would blame Augustine for enshrining a dualist worldview that downgrades nature and the sexualised body in favour of a masculine principle of creation. He dismisses “the standard feminist charges” against him (blaming Eve and so forth). Those who see him as anticipating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/my-hero-rene-descartes-kelman\" title=\"\">Descartes</a>’ sense of the self as solitary and reflective miss his emphasis on the relationship with God and the Christian community. And as for those who blame him for “muddles about sexuality”, Williams’s attitude is that, well, there are more important things to talk about. (Perhaps there are signs here of his weariness with the issue of Anglican homophobia, which he could not resolve as archbishop.)</p> <p>The complicity between Williams and his subject makes this book a frustrating read for the secular-minded. He has no interest in exploring those aspects of Augustine that might not match modern tastes, whether the ethical delinquencies of his views on slavery and women or the complex blend of non-Christian forces that helped shape him (there is little in here on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/apr/04/classics-classics\" title=\"\">Cicero</a> or neoplatonism, for example, and nothing on Manichaeism, the religion he followed until his conversion in his late 30s). The Augustine that emerges is, rather, a 21st-century, liberal, cerebral Anglican. In fact, it is sometimes hard even to tell who is speaking, Augustine or Williams, given the latter’s fondness for “paraphrasing Augustine quite freely” (Williams’s own words). When we read, for example, that “God’s active love is what draws us across the distance between creator and creature”, it is unclear whether this is offered as an authentic rendering of Augustine’s thought, as Williams’s supplementation of it, or even as an authoritative pronouncement about the truth of existence. All three at once, perhaps.</p> <p>I suspect Williams would gently reflect that this kind of finickiting about historical difference misses the point. The truth he urges us to embrace is not anchored to particular moments in human time. In fact, according to Augustine-Williams, our awareness of the illusory nature of time is – along with sin and embodiedness – part of the limitation that we have to accept to be good Christians. Only once we have contemplated and embraced our own incompleteness can we be “transformed into a moment in the history of Christ”. This is the position from which Augustine himself concluded (in Williams’s paraphrase) that “the Psalms are the words of Jesus, the Word who speaks in all scripture”, even though they were composed perhaps as much as a millennium before Jesus’s birth, in a different language and an unimaginably different context. To those who see religion not as truth but as part of the human fabric of history, however, such claims are hard to swallow.</p> <p>Lane Fox is, as one would expect, much more sedulously historical: Augustine interests him partly as a captivating personality, but more as a witness to his age, both to the social realities of life in Roman north Africa and to the religious revolutions of the late fourth century AD, the era that saw the faith that had tentatively been adopted by the Emperor Constantine embedded as the primary state religion of the Roman empire. His is a biography not of Augustine himself (the benchmark is still Peter Brown’s <em>Augustine of Hippo</em>, 1967), but of the <em>Confessions</em>. Whereas Williams proceeds by a series of deep soundings, Lane Fox’s precise prose clarifies, streamlines and contextualises, taking us chronologically from Augustine’s birth to his conversion. Along the way, the specifics of Augustine’s own experiences are revealed through comparison with and contrast to two other approximate contemporaries for whom there is plenty of evidence, the brilliant pagan orator Libanius and the charismatic Libyan bishop Synesius.</p> <p>Lane Fox richly paints the quirky, colourful, bizarre life of a provincial, middle class, Latin-speaking north African, whose first allegiance had been to the dualist “true Christianity” of Mani (“the only world religion”, we learn, “to have believed in the redemptive power of farts”), and who came to Rome as an outsider, reliant primarily on his native talents. Unlike Williams, Lane Fox has no aversion to the corporeal: he revels in Augustine’s “fornications”, his reflections on the male orgasm, ancient forms of birth control, the moment when he dared “to lust” and “procure the fruits of death” within a church (a hook-up, Lane Fox argues, not an act of masturbation), the sex-mad priests who deserve to be defrocked, his eventual embrace of Paul’s association of sin with the sexualised body. There are, indeed, rather more references to breasts in this book than one might have expected. But for all that Lane Fox is probably the least Augustinian reader of Augustine imaginable, he is nevertheless sympathetic to his subject’s theological preoccupations, carefully unpacking what was at stake in his conversion and preaching, and his handling of the schism with the Donatists. This is how ancient texts should be discussed: with brio, panache, erudition and intuition, but also with sensitivity to the challenges posed by alien cultural frameworks.</p> <p>• Tim Whitmarsh’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/09/battling-the-gods-atheism-ancient-world-review\" title=\"\"><em>Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World</em></a> is published by Faber.

series","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Regarding Zoe Williams’ review of How It Works: The Dad (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/12/ladybird-the-dad-review-zoe-williams\" title=\"\">Review</a>, 14 May), many Guardian readers are probably unaware that the original satire on the Ladybird children’s education series was an art project written and illustrated by <a href=\"http://miriamelia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Miriam and Ezra Elia</a> – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/22/the-flyaway-success-of-the-ladybird-art-prank\" title=\"\">We Go to the Gallery</a> – and published under their own imprint, Dung Beetle Books. When the book first appeared in 2014, Penguin erupted in fury and demanded that the entire print run be withdrawn and destroyed. When this didn’t work, they decided it was a case of “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em”, and published their own comic series under a different creative team. Unlike these subsequent titles, such as The Dad, We Go to the Gallery was genuinely funny – a brilliant spoof on both the Ladybird style of education and the contemporary art world. Anyone disappointed by the official Ladybird parodies and with a glancing interest in contemporary art is advised to get hold of the Elia version, which will have them laughing out loud. I believe the authors are currently preparing a sequel.<br /><strong>Davina Thackara</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a

months before her 20th birthday. Is It Evil Not to Be Sure?, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/lena-dunham-surprise-book-sells-out-in-24-hours-is-it-evil-not-to-be-sure\">her just-released book</a>, is a collection of short and very casual expressions of exactly these kinds of searching impulses, with small scenes and observations pulled real time from her sophomore year at Oberlin college. Though Dunham’s since become a household name, after her success with her TV show, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/girls\">Girls</a>, and her co-created publishing company, <a href=\"http://www.lennyletter.com/\">Lenny</a>, the young woman who kept the brief notes collected in Is It Evil was deeply unknown, in many ways even to herself. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/lena-dunham-surprise-book-sells-out-in-24-hours-is-it-evil-not-to-be-sure\">Lena Dunham's surprise book sells out in 24 hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dunham surprised her fans and followers on Tuesday morning this week, announcing the publication of a diary she’d kept from October 2005 through to the following autumn. In the introduction, she describes the project as more of an “informal log” recently rediscovered on an old hard drive. She decided to release the text as both a limited edition zine and an ebook, the proceeds from which she’ll be donating to <a href=\"http://www.girlswritenow.org/\">Girls Write Now</a>, a New York City organization that pairs teen girls with grown writing mentors. As she was writing what became Is it Evil, she had been calling the collection of word documents Creative Snippets and Observations. (The new title is, to say the least, an improvement.) </p> <p>The question of what is right and what is wrong appears throughout the book, taking many forms – though quite often as lightly sketched humorous quips and small doses of self-pity, with an almost total lack of analysis. Entries range in length from a few words to a few paragraphs and have the feeling of a kind of list, “snippets” as signposts for a young woman just beginning to create a cohesive map of herself. Of course there is almost no context, of course the questions just lay there, simultaneously urgent and inert; this is merely an outline, the very first stages of building a life.</p> <p>As their writer begins to fumble into sexual relationships, many of the pieces here are anxious aphorisms about desire and discomfort­, which will hardly come as a shock to anyone with a passing familiarity with Dunham’s work. In her first book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/30/not-that-kind-of-girl-lena-dunham-review-memoir\">Not that Kind of Girl</a>, Dunham described a certain queasiness about sex, an uneasy pairing with her desire to perform an easy ribaldry, to shock and to confess as part of a radical history of women doing and saying the things we’ve been told not to. “I have always believed that women chronicling their own lives, even (or especially) at their most mundane, is a radical act,” Dunham said, in a statement on her reasoning behind releasing the surprise book. On Girls, and in her indie feature film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/29/tiny-furniture-review\">Tiny Furniture</a>, Dunham performs the roles she’s written with a built-in sense of obligation regarding sexual liberation – the message being that if millennial women are free to fuck, we probably should.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/29/tiny-furniture-review\">Tiny Furniture – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the major strengths of Is It Evil is Dunham’s ability to confront exactly this paradox, and to do so over and over again, but without an audience in mind. Writing only for herself at the time, Dunham had no need to create conclusions, only to jot down enough to remember the many (and contradictory) impulses she’d experienced. “I could surrender to a very sad feeling but my father thinks that’s a waste of time,” Dunham wrote a month or so after having sex for the first time. “So now it’s part of my personal mythology: I lost my virginity to a total psychopath.” After a paragraph break, a little injection of white space, she continues: “I saw him shaving with his hat on.” </p> <p>The way she records her jealousies and insecurities, about sex and the men she has sex with, is shot through with irony, and reading her private thoughts from the period is an experience in tenderness. To be so young and unsure is a burden, and it is precisely the kind of thing we as a species seem to prefer to forget as soon as we’ve shrugged it off. At 20, I craved certainty and self-assuredness, developing a taste for the minor cruelty and shallow irony so clearly on display in Is it Evil. Now it’s plain that certain of these affectations were things I wore with all the awkwardness of a costume; it was a time for trying things on, and looking back it’s easy to see how silly I looked, not understanding the difference between what lays heavy on the heart and what in life is to be held so lightly it may as well just float away.</p> <p>Dunham introduces the book with an essay wherein she describes how proud she is of her younger self for keeping this scant record, for making it through a tumultuous year of firsts. And yet, the specificity of Dunham’s experiences doesn’t fully bear on the way she’s created these sketches. The airiness of her record leaves plenty of room for readers to breeze through, for the jokes to land and for the spirit of experimentation to permeate. There are moments where you can forget that these highly personal things happened to the woman whose face you’ve seen peering back at you from pretty much every newsstand and website. Instead you are confronted with collected fragments, little shards of someone’s – anyone’s – first attempts at adult life, catching the light there in the palm of your hand. In the end, nothing here is evil, and nothing is sure. </p> <ul> <li>Is It Evil Not to Be Sure? is available in the US and the UK in a limited-edition hard copy and electronic forms.</li>

Yet Holmström was in her 50s before Indian, and specifically Tamil, literature became her focus. Her first anthology, for Virago, The Inner Courtyard: Stories by Indian Women (1990), exhibited what would become the hallmarks of her translations and critiques of both classical and contemporary female writers. She was determined to produce an anthology based on a common identity and experience, linking politics to literature, and avoiding “foreignisation” or “exoticism”.</p> <p>Further anthologies followed at intervals, including Writing from India (Figures in a Landscape) (1994); Waves: An Anthology of Fiction and Poetry (2001) and The Rapids of a Great River: The Penguin Book of Tamil Poetry (2009). The most recent, Lost Evenings, Lost Lives (2016, with Sascha Ebeling), makes a fitting swansong: it is an impassioned account of the suffering of Tamil women in the 30-year civil war in Sri Lanka, and a vindication of poetry as truth-telling, throughout a period of news blackouts.</p> <p>Holmström fought hard to convey the right voice when rendering Tamil into English, such a different language: “Readers can’t quite grasp the notion that languages differ hugely in lexis as well as syntax; that one language doesn’t move into another automatically ... Words and sentences may be the bricks and mortar, but it has a structure as a whole that you are continually aspiring towards.”</p> <p>Other translations, undertaken with an ever surer touch, were of short stories and novels by Ambai (the pseudonym of CS Lakshmi), Ashokamitran, Bama, Imayam, Sundara Ramaswamy, Na Muthuswamy, Cheran, Mowni, A Madhaviah, Salma and Pudhumaipithan.</p> <p>In an interview for the Hindu Times in 2013, Holmström spoke of the changes in Tamil women’s literature that she had observed over 30 years: “Many women are feminists, and articulate their feminism very clearly. But I believe the driving force in their writing – or in the best examples of their work – is not cerebral and generalised but springs from personal, felt experience. Hence Bama’s Dalit politics; hence Salma’s insights into the restricted world of Muslim women; hence the focus of Sri Lankan poets on the violence done to women during and after the war; hence the younger women poets of Tamil and their politics of sexuality.”</p> <p>Holmström’s background was Christian, although she lost her faith in her teens. She was born in Salem, near Bangalore (Bengaluru), Karnataka. Both her paternal grandfather and her father, Paul David Devanandan, were theologians; her maternal grandfather was the founder of the First Church of South India and her mother, Hannah (nee Amaruvati) graduated from the Women’s Christian College.</p> <p>Although her mother took her own life when Lakshmi was only two years old, she retained a memory of her, and always kept her photo on her study wall. Her father soon remarried, to the chagrin of Lakshmi, her older sister, Nalini, and her younger brother, Marcus, and their childhood was not a happy one. Lakshsmi graduated from the Women’s Christian College in Madras (now Chennai), and then from St Hilda’s College, Oxford, in English literature. Her interest shifted towards anglophone Indian authors as she completed her DLitt, also at Oxford, on RK Narayan.</p> <p>Lakshmi met her future husband, Mark Holmström, while they were both undergraduates. They married in 1960, and later travelled to New York, where he worked for Unesco and she as librarian at the Indian consulate general. After two years they returned to the UK. Mark became a sociology lecturer at the University of East Anglia, and Lakshmi also taught, for seven years as a schoolteacher in Norwich, and later, from 2003 until 2006, as the first Royal Literary Fund fellow specialising in literary translation at UEA.</p> <p>Holmström won numerous literary awards and was made an MBE in 2011. For her, the mission always mattered more than the recognition. “The most difficult part of translation is, I believe, finding the ‘right’ pitch and voice of the original, and to try and match that. I won’t say ‘replicate’; that’s impossible. But there is also the hard graft of familiarising oneself with the history and cultural background of the work. A translator should never be afraid of asking questions.”</p> <p>She is survived by her husband and two daughters, Radhika and Savitri; her grandchildren, Miriam, Naomi, Isaac and Noah; and her sister.</p> <p><em> • </em>Lakshmi Holmström, writer and translator, born 1 June 1935; died 6 May

Flood","headline":"Kafkaesque: a word so overused it has lost all meaning?","trailText":"Han Kang’s Man Booker International winner has prompted much use of the word – but do we really understand what it means?","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>On Monday night, Han Kang’s strange, disturbing, brilliant novel The Vegetarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/man-booker-international-prize-serves-up-victory-to-the-vegetarian-han-kang-deborah-smith\">won the Man Booker International prize</a>. Shortly afterwards, <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/trend-watch/kafkaesque-2016-05-17\">dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster announced</a> that searches for the word “Kafkaesque” had “spiked dramatically” in the wake of her win, because the novel “has been described by its British publishers (and by a number of reviewers) as Kafkaesque”.</p> <p>Merriam-Webster is not wrong. The Vegetarian’s US publisher calls the novel “a darkly allegorical, Kafkaesque tale of power, obsession and one woman’s struggle to break free from the violence both without and within her”. I spoke to the chair of judges for the Man Booker International prize, Boyd Tonkin, about the novel, and he said that at times when reading it, “I was thinking of Kafka, because it’s about the change of state … part of the heroine’s protest is not getting rid of meat, but getting rid of her humanity, becoming a plant or a tree.”</p> <p>The dictionary defines the adjective, incidentally, as “of, relating to, or suggestive of Franz Kafka or his writings; especially: having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality”. Nightmarish and illogical is also what I’d have taken from a description of something as Kafkaesque, with an insectile undercurrent beneath it all (I don’t think that last bit is right, incidentally, but it’s what the word makes me think of).</p> <p>But Merriam-Webster also admits that the word, which saw its first recorded use in English in 1946, “is so overused that it’s begun to lose its meaning”, a word that a columnist for Toronto’s Globe and Mail argued is “tossed around with cavalier imprecision, applied to everything from an annoying encounter with a petty bureaucrat to the genocidal horrors of the Third Reich”.</p> <p>Kafka is not the only author to lend his name to an adjective - Merriam-Webster also points to Dickensian and Byronic, but there are many. Proustian. Joycean. Miltonic. Chaucerian. Pinteresque. Woolfian. Faulknerian.</p> <p>Perhaps almost as abused as Kafkaesque is Orwellian. The OED defines it as “characteristic of Orwell’s writings, esp. the totalitarian state in his dystopian account of the future, Nineteen Eighty-Four”. But <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/weekinreview/simpler-terms-if-it-s-orwellian-it-s-probably-not.html\">the New York Times says</a> its use “reduces Orwell’s palette to a single shade of noir. It brings to mind only sordid regimes of surveillance and thought control and the distortions of language that make them possible”, while<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/nov/11/reading-group-orwellian-1984\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/society/everything-orwellian-say-idiots-2013092579759\">an excellent Daily Mash article</a> argues that the word has “nothing to do with having to put your recycling out” and that “similarly, speed cameras are not ‘Orwellian’”, because “Winston Smith does not spend Nineteen Eighty-Four trying to weasel out of a £75 fine for doing 70 on the A12”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/translated-fiction-sells-better-uk-english-fiction-elena-ferrante-haruki-murakami\">Translated fiction sells better in the UK than English fiction, research finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But back to The Vegetarian, and how Kafkaesque it is, whatever that actually means to us. Tonkin also compared the novel to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and to The Bell Jar and The Yellow Wallpaper, making it, I suppose, Ovidian, Plathian, and Perkins Gilmanesque, as well (although I’m not sure if that’ll make it into the blurb). But aside from the misuse and overuse of Kafkaesque, there’s something rather nice about the fact that enough people were interested in the winner of a literary award for translated fiction that a sizeable crowd took the trouble to look it up. Perhaps this means that the growth in translated fiction over the last 15 years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/translated-fiction-sells-better-uk-english-fiction-elena-ferrante-haruki-murakami\">revealed last week by the Man Booker International prize</a>, is set to continue.

Please spare them","trailText":"I don’t know whether it’s possible to dumb down Dan Brown’s blockbuster, but it seems the publisher thinks this will win over the perfectly capable teen market","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/dan-brown-release-ya-version-da-vinci-code-330191\">Dan Brown’s publisher has announced that this autumn</a> it is going to release a new, abridged version of the Da Vinci Code aimed at the lucrative YA market. The implication I took from this news is that The Da Vinci Code is about to be dumbed down. Even further.</p> <p>The fear that then gripped me then was far greater than that of my own death. I saw a future filled with too many ellipses, overly complex descriptions and arbitrary races against time. Suddenly, despite all the laws of reason and the many rules relating to logic … Penguin Random House … one of the last few publishing houses and the sole guardian of the UK rights of one of the most successful novels written in the last 20 years … were reissuing a rip-roaringly simple book, made even simpler? Alongside my attractive sidekick, I summoned all my faculties and strength as I began to realise that the time for bad Dan Brown parodies was almost over … I had to … try … to think … like a normal person again… </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/16/dan-brown-inferno-plot-to-influence\">Dan Brown still can't write, but he deserves some respect | Alan Yuhas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leaving Brown’s style aside (for now), the publishers have suggested that their main adjustment will be to make a few judicious trims. (I’ll leave it to you to come up with your own jokes about how that may actually improve the text.) If they remove the words “then” and “when” and all the pointless present participles Brown uses to start his sentences, this venture might actually result in a Da Vinci Code that fits into an agreeably-sized pamphlet.</p> <p>The ruthless part of me has to admit that the plan makes sense. I object to the idea that the 13+ age group that the publisher aims to attract with this “new” outing might not be able to cope with a full adult book (let alone Dan Brown’s bestseller). But I can see how his addictive blend of scary albino monks, square-jawed professors, gifted French cryptologists and sadomasochism might just appeal to a teenage audience. (Especially if the publishers emphasise the sadomasochism.)</p> <p>It’s also worth remembering the enduring power of The Da Vinci Code. Success with teenagers would be no more surprising than the fact that The Da Vinci Code has sold 82m copies, a healthy 81.9m more books than I’ve ever sold. It equates to one copy for every man, woman and child in the UK – with enough left over to also supply the entire populations of Greece and Sweden.</p> <p>But 82 million people can be wrong. Really wrong. It’s perfectly possible to speculate on how many of those millions of buyers actually read, enjoyed and finished the book. Given that during the years he was most prolific, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/21/dan-brown-oxfam-most-donated-books\">Brown was the most donated author in Oxfam bookstores</a> multiple years in a row, people seem keen to forget they ever owned the damn books. And I’m really in no position to cast aspersions: I read it myself. All of it. I hated myself. I hated Robert Langdon. I hated the guff about “orgiastic rituals” and Opus Dei. But I still had to know what happened. I still tore through the pages, not ripping them.</p> <p>So I won’t be all that surprised if plenty more teenagers do the same and this whole sorry venture does exactly what it means to do: make money. Part of me wants to set down extravagant warnings. I want to tell those teen readers of the future to go elsewhere. But there’s no point. </p> <p>The truth is that – to borrow one of Brown’s famously inept images – “Pandora is out of her box”. The author hit a winning formula. Literary snobs like me may love to mock – but there’s no way that we can stop him. In fact, the sooner the kids get any version of The Da Vinci Code out of their systems – it’s due out in September – and start moving on to other books, the better.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4jbdf","wordcount":"657","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a6ca677d2e92b17fc81f0993a992b473e34b9cd/0_451_3504_2103/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-05-24T23:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>I don’t know whether it’s possible to dumb down Dan Brown’s blockbuster, but it seems the publisher thinks this will win over the perfectly capable teen market</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/do-teens-really-need-a-special-ya-version-of-dan-browns-the-da-vinci-code\">YA readers react to Dan Brown’s teen adaptation: ‘Why?’</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/18/the-da-vinci-code-to-be-reformulated-for-ya-readers-dan-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2016/may/18/the-da-vinci-code-to-be-reformulated-for-ya-readers-dan-brown","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"4a6ca677d2e92b17fc81f0993a992b473e34b9cd","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a6ca677d2e92b17fc81f0993a992b473e34b9cd/0_451_3504_2103/2000.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*8476625","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/4a6ca677d2e92b17fc81f0993a992b473e34b9cd","suppliersReference":"SSJ38991","altText":"Audrey Tautou and Tom Hanks in the 2006 film of The Da Vinci Code.","caption":"Run away! ...

The devastation in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/391688/s/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047/\"><em>The Mandibles</em></a> is monetary – its effect is to destroy the US economy so completely that the impoverished hordes are fleeing to Mexico. The formerly wealthy, who had installed themselves in France, must now go home because the almighty dollar is worth nothing, replaced as the international currency by the “bancor”. Your head may be spinning, because the details of finance are more abstruse than nuclear exchange, asteroid impacts or the second coming, but as she follows her characters through sufferings and accommodations, Shriver manages to make her case – that civilisation is a delicate network and what we have, even if that is only toilet paper and socks, is precious.</p> <p>To begin with, the Mandibles are a prosperous Manhattanite bunch. “Great Grand Man” has an old-style fortune with its roots in manufacturing; his daughter, Enola, is a prominent author; and his son-in-law, Lowell, is an economist at Georgetown. Only his granddaughter Florence hasn’t really made it – she works at a homeless shelter and lives with Esteban, who works in an old folks’ home. The hard-to-handle cousin, Jarred, is a farmer upstate. The character who comes the closest to being Shriver’s protagonist is Florence’s son, Willing, 13 when the novel opens in 2029. He is simultaneously a snarky teenager and the most observant and perceptive commenter on the onslaught of misfortunes. He is well-intentioned, but will act outside the law if he has to.</p> <p>And he has to, as does his cousin, Savannah, who had been intending to go to the Rhode Island School of Design but opts for the sex trade instead. As the dollar collapses, American exceptionalism morphs into general lawlessness and disrepair, though a smartphone-like gadget called a “fleX” and the internet continue to be of use. The New York Times has fallen by the wayside; nothing is said about the Guardian.</p> <p>The energy of Shriver’s style counteracts the remorselessness of her vision. The world that the Mandible family must negotiate is evoked in seamless detail: what they are able to buy, how they feed themselves, what they must throw away, the loss of all their possessions until their lost prosperity is represented only by a set of monogrammed silverware that they take with them when they have to escape on foot from the house where they have all gathered, and not for a family reunion. At one point, she writes of Willing, “He picked up a $100 bill, an original issue green-back – too small to blow your nose in, not absorbent enough to clean your glasses.” It is worthless, but “the distinctive flannel texture, the painfully pompous engraving, triggered an unexpected nostalgia. He pocketed the bill.” For the most part, the Mandibles themselves partake of Shriver’s energy – they are hardy and resourceful and though it might cross the reader’s mind that suicide would be a viable alternative, the Mandibles press on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/13/lionel-shriver-bankers-perfect-villains\">Lionel Shriver: is there any better villain than a banker? ​</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which doesn’t mean that I like them. They come across as real, but more like friends of friends that you prefer to see only at very large parties. At the beginning, they are secure and self-satisfied, part of the 1% and convinced of their status, not nearly as insightful or playful as their author, who names one of Willing’s cousins “Goog” and the other one “Bing”. Willing is more sympathetic, and so what happens to him at the beginning of part two is especially horrifying, more so than the mass shootings of elderly pensioners whose benefits are linked to the inflation rate. After this section, you may feel that you can’t go on, but you will.</p> <p>The author and I don’t agree about the seminal causes of the impending dystopia: I think failure to address climate change when it was first understood in 1968 and the rapacious greed of corporations is what will destroy us; Shriver is more wary of the government, at first inept, then intrusive, and always demanding higher taxes. She makes an interesting case, however, and manages to twist the plot over and over so that unexpected events happen all the way to the end. One thing I really like is her coining of made-up slang for her younger generation of characters and her resolutely materialist analysis of what could be coming. She, of course, is wrong. So am I, so was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/hgwells\">HG Wells</a>, so was Nevil Shute. Every dystopia is a picture of what the author most dreads; Shriver is better than most at fleshing out her vision and bringing it alive.</p> <p>• Jane Smiley’s latest novel is <em>Golden Age</em> (Picador).</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4j5yv","wordcount":"781","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe7b883ce7cc6d2db039f0d8b27696357a2bd8c2/0_377_5878_3527/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-06-24T12:44:00Z","standfirst":"<p>A super-rich Manhattan family shows its will to survive as the dollar collapses</p>"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047-by-lionel-shriver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/may/18/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047-by-lionel-shriver","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"fe7b883ce7cc6d2db039f0d8b27696357a2bd8c2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe7b883ce7cc6d2db039f0d8b27696357a2bd8c2/0_377_5878_3527/140.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2016 Rex Features.

In One Thumping Lie Only, his essay on his writing published in Edward Blishen’s The Thorny Paradise (1975), Fisk called his stories “believable realism”, arguing that everything must make sense once that allowable lie has been swallowed.</p> <p>He took contemporary issues and, by adding to them speculation and technology, encouraged children to look at “new times, possibilities and situations”. “How much more exciting the microscope or telescope’s viewpoint than one’s own!” he wrote. “How much more interesting the possibility than the fact; the drawn conclusion than the stated premise; the freedom of fantasy than the chain of present circumstances!”</p> <p>Well-crafted and bold in their plotting, with stories that often included serious threats and uncertainties, particularly when space travel was involved, Fisk’s novels gave children serious subjects to think about. These included how to survive in space, for a group of children after the hijacking of their spaceship by a fanatical airman, in Space Hostages (1967) and cloning in A Rag, a Bone and a Hank of Hair. Fisk put children in jeopardy in imagined and unknown worlds, and while his futures were brighter than the dark fictional dystopias of today, they shared with them the belief that only children, who are less corrupt than adults, can protect the best human values.</p> <p>Nicholas Fisk was a pseudonym for David Higginbottom. He was born in London into a family with a strong creative tradition. His father, William, author of Frightfulness in Modern Art (1928), was an artist and art teacher. His mother, Margaret (nee Willmore), came from a theatrical family and was the sister of the Irish actor Micheál Mac Liammóir. Fisk was educated at Ardingly college, West Sussex, and left school at 16 after his father died. His mother felt that he would be better doing a job than continuing his education.</p> <p>In his brief memoir of his teenage years, Pig Ignorant (1992), Fisk described his adolescence in London during the blitz and the backdrop of uncertainty and danger that it gave to his life. His first job was working for a theatrical agent, secured on the strength of his phone manner and the fact that he could type. The office was conveniently situated in Covent Garden, and his evenings were spent in the jazz clubs of Soho.</p> <p>A self-taught jazz-guitarist, he later played with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-stephane-grappelli-1286414.html\">Stéphane Grappelli</a> and Django Reinhardt, and he also became a proficient enough illustrator to be a cartoonist for the Daily Sketch. After the second world war, during which he served as an RAF meteorological officer, Fisk worked for the publishers Lund Humphries before moving to a career in advertising.</p> <p>Fisk tried his hand as a writer and illustrator, first at non-fiction, with Look at Cars (1959). A few further non-fiction titles followed, including Lindbergh the Lone Flier (1968) and Richthofen the Red Baron (1968), both illustrated by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/raymond-briggs\">Raymond Briggs</a>. His first novel for children, The Bouncers (1964), carried his own illustrations. This and The Fast Green Car (1965) were both realistic children’s adventures of a traditional kind that drew kindly and wittily on his own childhood.</p> <p>Space Hostages was a much bolder novel. Fisk wrote later that he had found Geoffrey Household’s Rogue Male published as part of Puffin’s teen list Peacock: “I thought, if the publisher thinks fit to offer this title to children, the world must be changing. For the better.” Fisk later became an active contributor to the Puffin Club, taking part in the hugely imaginative Puffin extravaganzas, writing stories for Puffin Post and visiting schools. He cared a great deal about his readers and was punctilious about answering all the letters children wrote to him.</p> <p>Fisk published almost a book a year for 30 years until 1996, when his failing eyesight due to macular degeneration made writing impossible. His stories lost none of their originality and continued to delight readers.</p> <p>Fisk’s wife, Dorothy (nee Richold), whom he married in 1949, died in 2007. He is survived by their twin daughters, Nichola and Moyra, and a son, Steven. Another son, Christopher, died in 2015.</p> <p>• Nicholas Fisk (David Higginbottom), writer, born 14 October 1923; died 10 May

The psychologist whose work informed the movie Inside Out discovers how to get to the top","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p><sup>“</sup>It is far safer to be feared than loved,” wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/27/prince-niccolo-machiavelli-tim-parks\">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> in<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/prince-45.html\"> <em>The Prince</em></a>, the founding text of the philosophy of realpolitik. These days, anyone wishing to establish their credentials as a hard-headed commentator on global affairs need only echo that bleak assessment: sure, it’s all very well for do-gooders to preach love and charity – but force, or the threat of it, is the only language everyone always understands. The American psychologist <a href=\"http://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/dacher-keltner\">Dacher Keltner</a> begs to differ. When you closely observe chimpanzees – or other primates, such as kindergartners or university students – you’ll find it is not the bullies and manipulators who gain power, he writes. Rather, it is those who demonstrate empathy and enthusiasm, solve others’ problems and otherwise further the greater good. Were that the end of the story, the world would be ruled exclusively by kindly philanthropists. Readers may have noticed that this is not the case.</p> <p>This is the “paradox” of Keltner’s title: it is true that being nice is the best path to power, but achieving power reliably turns people nasty. “The seductions of power,” as he puts it, “induce us to lose the very skills that enabled us to gain power in the first place.” Research demonstrates that people who feel powerful are more likely to act impulsively: to have affairs; to drive inconsiderately; to lie; to argue that it is justifiable for them to break rules others should follow; and, in one entertaining study by Keltner and his colleagues, to steal sweets from children. Rich people even shoplift more than the poor. All in all, accumulating power seems to trigger a tendency to self-absorption: in experiments, when people are asked to draw the letter E on their own foreheads so that others can read it, powerful people are more likely to draw it the right way round to themselves, and backwards to onlookers. In a literal sense, they no longer see the world from other people’s perspective.</p> <p>Keltner, whose earlier work on emotions informed the Pixar movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inside-out\"><em>Inside Out</em></a>, marshals copper-bottomed evidence for his argument. Unfortunately, he also suffers from a severe case of counterintuitivitis, insisting that his findings show our existing ideas of power to be utterly wrongheaded. But they don’t. The name of Machiavelli is deployed throughout the book to represent the old-school view, but in fact his ruthlessness shocked his Renaissance contemporaries, who fancied themselves more sophisticated. In modern times, “soft power” as a technique of diplomacy is decades old. As for the notion that power contains the seeds of its own destruction, it is hard to imagine that Sophocles or Shakespeare would disagree.</p> <p>But if the power paradox isn’t all that surprising, it is true that we fail to take full account of its implications. If we did, we would reach some alarming insights, especially about politics and organisational life. We hope to bring change by electing or appointing new and different leaders – yet the power paradox suggests it is precisely through becoming leaders that they lose the qualities we saw in them. Those at the top of the tree “may be the very people most blind to the problems of powerlessness, poverty, and inequality” – even if they started out well meaning. Representative democracy, on this account, seems pretty much doomed to fail. It is only a partial compensation to realise that the paradox also implies that political hopefuls such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> – angry, manipulative bullies – are less likely to acquire power to begin with.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/10/game-of-thrones-black-lives-matter-dacher-keltner-power-paradox-machiavelli\">How modern power works: less Game of Thrones, more Black Lives Matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sole basis for optimism is Keltner’s conclusion that serving the common good is, ultimately, in the self-interest of the powerful, if they can only resist the temptation to turn into jerks instead. “Stay focused on other people … Bring the good in others to completion … Take delight in the delights of others, as they make a difference in the world,” he advises. However, his and other researchers’ findings suggest that it is the powerless, not the powerful, who will be most receptive to that message (people low in power report feeling compassion for others far more frequently). One can only hope that a new generation of psychologically informed advisers will take our leaders aside and murmur in their ears the message that, in the long run, compassionate policies are the best way to consolidate their own dominance. Even if you are not a kind person deep down, in other words, it pays to do kind things. This is surely right. Although put like that, doesn’t it start to sound a little duplicitous?

The book gripped me entirely. To be honest, it probably wouldn’t have hooked me in as much were I reading it later.<br /></p> <p>Brown’s novel did two crucial things for me at the age when I started thinking hard about who I was and what was important to me.</p> <p>Firstly, it helped me take religion as <em>a story </em>rather than <em>the story</em>. Influenced by my religious grandmother and school, I collected icons as a child and was all into bells and smells. At 12, I developed ideas about gender. Feminism and religion, in my teen mind, contradicted each other. And Brown came just at the right time, with his theory of an anti-feminist conspiracy of the Church in having erased Magdalene’s role in Jesus’s and Christianity’s lives. The protests that ensued in the Catholic and the Christian Orthodox Churches only confirmed my new discovery that, alongside important values, religion held a lot of… myths.</p> <p>Secondly, the book got me into thinking about art. While reading The Da Vinci Code, I stared at my dad’s book of reproductions of Leonardo’s paintings for hours. Visual art has since become a big part of my identity.</p> <p>So, if the book made me think about some of my most important values, I guess I... got it? And so did my cousin, aged 13, who read three other Dan Brown books afterwards, and, it seems, so did many other teens. If anything, I wonder whether a very large proportion of the novel’s readers were indeed teens, helping it to reach its sales figures of more than 200 million copies in 44 languages.<br /></p> <p>But the outrage at this publishing decision is not just about patronising teenagers. It’s also about insulting a fiction genre. Holly Bourne, author of bestselling YA titles Soulmates, The Manifesto On How To Be Interesting and Am I Normal Yet?, protested that the rewriting of The<em> </em>Da Vinci Code implies that:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/holly_bourneYA/status/732878350105071616\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">YA authors&#39; writing process: We write adult books and then edit out all the hard bits so the ickle teens can understands them</p>&mdash; Holly Bourne (@holly_bourneYA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holly_bourneYA/status/732878350105071616\">May 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/holly_bourneYA/status/732878483039358976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DAMN YOU DAN, YOU&#39;VE BLOWN OUR COVER</p>&mdash; Holly Bourne (@holly_bourneYA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holly_bourneYA/status/732878483039358976\">May 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>So why is Dan Brown re-writing The Da Vinci Code for YA audience, cough cough, market?

If you have to silence the other side, your own arguments can’t be very strong","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>As the president of PEN America, I was deeply honored to have JK Rowling attend our gala to receive the PEN/Allen Foundation Award for Literary Service. Rowling gave a brief but exquisite address in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/17/jk-rowling-defends-donald-trumps-right-to-be-offensive-pen-america\">she lauded free speech</a> in the broadest terms, saying, “The tides of populism and nationalism currently sweeping many developed countries have been accompanied by demands that unwelcome and inconvenient voices be removed from public discourse … Intolerance of alternative viewpoints is spreading to places that make me, a moderate and a liberal, most uncomfortable.” Speaking out about an online petition that sought to ban Donald Trump from visiting the UK, she said, “I find almost everything that Mr Trump says objectionable. I consider him offensive and bigoted. But he has my full support to come to my country and be offensive and bigoted there. His freedom to speak protects my freedom to call him a bigot. His freedom guarantees mine.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Freedom of speech cannot be constrained to freedom to express one’s own point of view</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Commenting that this libertarian position must be taken “without caveats or apologies”, she said: “If you seek the removal of freedoms from an opponent simply on the grounds that they have offended you, you have crossed the line to stand alongside tyrants who imprison, torture and kill on exactly the same justification.”</p> <p> Voltaire famously defended the rights of his critics even as he passionately opposed their critiques. “The supposed right of intolerance is absurd and barbaric,” he wrote. “It is the right of the tiger; nay, it is far worse, for tigers do but tear in order to have food, while we rend each other for paragraphs.” Speech has its limits, and not only in the prohibition against crying “Fire!” in a crowded theater. There is such a thing as hate speech, and there are occasions when incitements to violence result in mass killings, as they did in Rwanda or in Nazi Germany. How does one strike the endlessly delicate balance between the need for security and the imperatives of free speech? This question has riven university campuses in the US and the UK, where attempts to ban speakers on the basis of their viewpoints has escalated into an often brutal silencing of diversity. Some students seem to have forgotten that justice relies on dissent, and that the purpose of a university education is to learn enough about the people with whom you disagree so that you can either disagree with them more effectively or let them change your mind.</p> <p>The current American election cycle has repeatedly called into question the principle that words – uttered, written down, heard – are the most powerful basis there has ever been for social justice. We have a presidential candidate who deploys insults and unapologetic lies to consolidate his power. We face a larger political establishment that has deliberately escalated xenophobia, frightening everyone so much that many Americans won’t leave their country, nor rise to welcome those who knock on our door. Trump’s incendiary statement about Mexico, “We’ll build a wall”, is itself a wall of words. It subverts the singular ability of language to help us sympathize with people who are different from us. Hatred is the inevitable consequence of this linguistic pollution, of using speech to construct barriers where we need bridges.</p> <p>PEN contends that what is said through high art, via journalism, or by anyone voicing a well-considered opinion are all connected. If reporters don’t find common cause with novelists, if essayists do not recognize the activists who confront corrupt power, we will all be diminished. There is no such thing as free speech only for writers. <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/william-carlos-williams\">William Carlos Williams</a> declared, “It is difficult to get the news from poems, yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.” At PEN, silence is not so golden. We hold free speech to a high standard: free speech entails the news that censors wish to hide, and the poetry that reveals our nature to us. Closing down the unsavory aspects of free expression is often advantageous in the short term, but it is dangerous in the long term. Freedom of speech cannot be constrained to freedom to express one’s own point of view.</p> <p>We never see ourselves so clearly as we do when we must defend our ideas to those who refute us. Those who force their challengers into reticence often weaken themselves more than those whom they seek to oppress. Lack of opposition is not only a hallmark of tyranny, but also a breeding ground for it. Any unconstrained force is corrupted if it is not constantly defending itself against the onslaught of resistance. The voices of those who are not free are often the most urgent and brilliant. As the American poet, essayist, and activist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus\">Emma Lazarus</a> said, “Until we are all free, we are none of us free.” We need to welcome dissent, because we grow from it. If you have to silence the other side, your own arguments can’t be very strong.</p> <p>In a time of increasing factionalism, the voice of the center has become ever more difficult to hear. It doesn’t mostly make such compelling news stories as Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders, as Vladimir Putin or Donald Trump. Conservatism from the left is even more shocking than conservatism from the right, and in addressing the petition to ban Trump from the UK, Rowling took it on squarely. Her remarks reflect the larger problem that many on the moderate left now find themselves cast as oppressors rather than as liberators. She argued for a wide and libertarian freedom, a gesture that seems particularly courageous given the number of people who have attacked her and her books. Indeed, she described an encounter with a religious fanatic in a toy store, and commented wryly, “I had no idea the phrase, ‘I’m praying for you,’ could sound so intimidating.”</p> <p>It is striking that the great moral voice of our time should be an author known most widely for her books for children. Morality comes early; christening was invented as a rite of infancy in part because the grasp of faith is strongest when it comes soonest. It is unsurprising that when God came to earth, he arrived as a baby. Children discovering moral issues for the first time are often the most profoundly moved by them. Though cliches about children’s innocence are naive, an early moral education can shape character deeper than any later dalliance in philosophy. Children draw on a limited number of experiences, and know many emotions and complexities through imagination; adults most often shift their focus to reality. As an idealist who understands what makes people tick, JK Rowling has kept the fantastical fresh while infusing it with wisdom, but while she gets tired of the daily grind of battling those who wish to silence her, she would not give it up. As she said, “My critics are at liberty to claim that I’m trying to convert children to Satanism. And I’m free to explain that I’m exploring human nature and morality, or to say, ‘You’re an idiot,’ depending on which side of the bed I got out of that day.” She has said repeatedly that morality is complicated, and that the presumption of good and evil is ingenuous.</p> <p>It is easy to mistake suppressed hatred for love, but suppressed hatred is the most bitter of poisons. When we constrain speech, we contain our humanity. The battle against such constraints is a noble and a permanent one. Nothing makes you champion free speech more vigorously than constraints on what you can say. </p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4jbe9","wordcount":"1265","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e46b89c061c9624a91fe9d81063a36059cfd11c/0_120_3600_2160/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-05-21T14:23:06Z","standfirst":"<p>We need to welcome dissent, because we grow from it.

As a writer who is feminist, one of my most fond interests is masculinity. Yes, <em>masculinity.</em> It may sound like an oxymoron but transforming men’s roles is a necessary task while transforming women’s roles. <br /></p> <p>That is why I’ve been writing about masculinity for years – about things that <a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2013/10/african-men.html\">I like about men</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2014/11/african-men-still-not-listening.html\"> things that I don’t like as much</a>, about my complex relationship to<a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2011/11/learning-to-love-white-men.html\"> white masculinity</a>, about <a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2011/04/is-masculinity-in-crisis.html\">crises in masculinity</a>, about why we should <a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2013/11/the-objectification-of-men.html\">objectify men</a>, <a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2013/09/we-need-to-eroticise-society.html\">eroticise society</a>, and stop associating <a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2012/07/male-genitalia-and-ideas-of-power.html\">male genitalia with violence</a>. <br /></p> <p>As a writer of African heritage, I am also interested in the specific ways that African masculinity is shaped: how are <a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2015/11/masculinity-in-african-film-the-seductive-case-of-run.html\">African men portrayed in film</a> and literature?<br /></p> <p>This led me to a literary male archetype, namely the heartthrob. Subsequently, it occurred to me that little has been said about the African literary heartthrob. Who, if anyone, would be the ultimate heartthrob in the African literary canon?<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3180a61690913f01a8943cf909e22a7cbd8c452\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3180a61690913f01a8943cf909e22a7cbd8c452/0_356_3370_4212/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Telegraph Hay Festival 2012HAY-ON-WYE, UNITED KINGDOM - JUNE 09: Writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie attends the Hay Festival on June 9, 2012 in Hay-on-Wye, Wales. (Photo by David Levenson/Getty Images)\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, author of Half of a Yellow Sun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The answer is, of course, Odenigbo, lead character in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s best-selling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/half-of-a-yellow-sun\">Half of a Yellow Sun</a>. Odenigbo is comparable to fictional characters such as Don Juan, Heathcliff and Romeo yet unlike his European equivalents, he has been cast in the shadow of his bombshell lover, Olanna, the female lead in the book. Although Odenigbo has caused women’s hearts to flap, his impact in the canon of romantic heroes goes largely unrecognised.<br /></p> <p>In my case, I might add, Odenigbo makes my heart flip more than flap. I’ve had my fair share of Odenigbos, thank you. Nevertheless, it is bothersome that analyses of the characters in Half of a Yellow Sun have mostly, and predictably, attempted to comprehend its female lead – Olanna – <a href=\"http://www.msafropolitan.com/2013/11/the-objectification-of-men.html\">neglecting</a> the book’s most memorable character in the process.<br /></p> <p>The fixation with Olanna is such that when the film version of Half of a Yellow Sun came out, displeased fans created a petition against what in their view was an erroneous casting. <br /></p> <p>However, fewer opposed (thank goodness) that Odenigbo, “a man who trusted the eccentricity that was his personality, a man who was not particularly attractive but who would draw the most attention in a room full of attractive men”, was played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/chiwetel-ejiofor\">Chiwitel Ejiofor</a>, an actor one could hardly call “not particularly attractive”. <br /></p> <p>In one scene, Olanna’s twin sister Kainene says to her, “There’s something very lazy about the way you have loved him so blindly … You’ve never even accepted that the man is ugly.”<br /></p> <p>Be that as it may, Odenigbo makes many women loose their marbles. So to what does Odenigbo owe his dazzling image if not his physical appearance?</p> <p>Firstly, he is brainy. Unlike men, who as studies suggest are <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/new-study-says-men-find-dating-intelligent-women-intimidating-a6700861.html\">not attracted to intelligent women</a>, studies have in contrast shown that<a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Women-See-Funny-Men-as-More-Intelligent-108417.shtml\"> women are indeed attracted to smart men</a>. And as a university professor, Odenigbo is categorically erudite. <br /></p> <p>Secondly, Odenigbo is passionate about social change. He is no abrasive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnamdi_Kanu\">Nnamdi Kanu</a>, but this pan-Africanist Igbo hero’s tribal passion makes a seismic volcano seem lukewarm. <br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Odenigbo is as macho as a pint of Guinness: to me, the feminist, this also makes him as charming as one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moreover, Odenigbo possesses that age-old aphrodisiac, confidence. Despite his mediocrity in the looks department, he does not for a second doubt that he can win the love of the ethereally beautiful Olanna.<br /></p> <p>Add to this that Odenigbo is as macho as a pint of Guinness: a trait, which to the feminist in me means that he is also as charming as one. But I must profess that, when Odenigbo softly holds Olanna’s hand while boisterously debating everything from Voltaire to Nkrumah to pan-Africanism; when he insists on treating their househelp, Ugwu, as his equal despite Ugwu’s own discomfort with the moment; and when he has rough sex with Olanna but she nevertheless feels as though “she is immersed in a mesh of soft feathers”, even my cynical heart flutters a little.<br /></p> <p>Not to mention during times of despair, when just like the Heathcliffs and Don Juans before him, the almighty Odenigbo becomes a mere shadow of his grandiloquent self. This transformation only proves that, despite Odenigbo’s macho posturing he is in fact, lo and behold, made of vulnerable human flesh and blood.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what speaks to the smitten reader’s most enamoured particle, is that Odenigbo never ceases to love Olanna. All the way through his youthful revolutionary days to his unplanned disloyalties, an atrocious war and right to the bitter end, his love of her is unfailingly adoring.

Priced at $25 (£17), with proceeds going to the mentoring programme <a href=\"http://www.girlswritenow.org/\">Girls Write Now</a>, its signed, 2,000-copy first print run had sold out by Wednesday morning, although it is still available as an ebook in the US.

She had been in bed after surgery, she said, and was “feeling painfully adult”.</p> <p>“I was, of course, full of the kind of mortification that is part and parcel with meeting a former version of yourself, a woefully misguided girl desperate to be embraced by even the least exemplary specimens of young American malehood,” wrote Dunham. “But I was also moved by – maybe even proud of – how carefully I had recorded that period of time, my younger self’s commitment to capturing the kinds of hyper-internal formative moments so often lost to adulthood.”</p> <p>The writer and actor said she had “always believed that women chronicling their own lives, even (or especially) at their most mundane, is a radical act”, and so decided to share the diaries as a short book, to benefit Girls Write Now. “I can’t think of a more admirable goal for an organisation, or a better reason to expose the oft troubling thought patterns of my final teenage year,” said the author.</p> <p>It was announced in April that Dunham would be teaming up with publisher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/random-house\">Random House</a> to launch her own publishing imprint, Lenny, in 2017.

Did you know that there’s a giant magnetic field in the Earth that makes a compass needle spin? It doesn’t matter where you are in the world, your compass needle will always point north.

Did you know that there are no fewer than 24 GPS satellites orbiting the Earth at any one time? Those satellites are bombarding the surface of the planet with messages that get picked up and read by GPS devices. These gadgets can then tell you, really accurately, where you are – anywhere in the world! Your mobile phone can work in a similar way, and most mobiles have a mapping app that will work really well… so long as your phone has signal...<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a69c58e5bb853dab0e3d3d94957e503587a994d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a69c58e5bb853dab0e3d3d94957e503587a994d9/0_0_2808_1705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Find your way using the stars!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Find your way using the stars!</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Nature</h2> <p>Let nature lead the way! You might not realise it, but nature provides us with loads of clues to help us navigate, from using the sun and the stars to working out which side of a tree has the most moss on it. If you live in the northern hemisphere and stand with your back to the sun at mid-day, your shadow will be facing due north. From that, you can work out all of the other points of the compass. You can use your watch as a compass too, so if you need to know which way is north, you don’t have to wait until 12 o’clock to do it. At night you can use the stars. You can find the North Star by using two constellations called the Little Dipper and the Big Dipper. Once you’ve found the North Star, you just draw an imaginary line down on to the horizon to find north, and from there you can work out all of the other points of the compass.<br /></p> <h2>Curiosity</h2> <p>The world is an AWESOME place, full of amazing things to see and experience and not all of them are a long way from home!

at 46: ‘I’d blown the one dream I’d always had – of being a writer’","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-01T08:45:08Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1031","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/45a25","body":"<p>How did I get here?</p> <p>I mean, seriously, it is a mystery to me. I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture. I wrote them all; I told their stories.</p> <p>And then I started to write a book.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time</p>","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","productionOffice":"US","trailText":"National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?</p>","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","productionOffice":"US","trailText":"Alex Malarkey co-wrote a bestselling book about a near-death experience – and then last week admitted he made it up.

mission is to deliver romance with all the “thrill and fantasy” in a more “healthier more grounded way”, reflecting the realities of women’s lives. <br /></p> <p>Their six debut titles are high-quality, absorbing, easy-to-read African love stories set in cities as diverse as Lagos, Cape Town, and Jos and they’ve had African literary experts buzzing on Twitter for weeks.<br /></p>

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep.

This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you.

unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle","headline":"UK freezes export of unique Erasmus manuscript by William Tyndale","byline":"Maev Kennedy","commentable":"true","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists.

You start with high hopes: compelling clues, a little character development, a rollercoaster of unexpected discoveries, but you often walk away disappointed. </p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Lisa Lutz’s The Spellman Files</a></strong> series turns the mystery novel on its head, and delivers an unexpectedly troubled and compulsive female protagonist in Izzy Spellman. It’s a fun escape with a relatable character. </p> <p><em><strong>Jessica Glenza, breaking news reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaGlenza\">@JessicaGlenza</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/james-risens-pay-any-price.html?_r=0\"><strong>Pay Any Price </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> James Risen</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://shaneharris.com/atwar/\"><strong>@War</strong><strong> by</strong> <strong>Shane Harris</strong></a> are both excellent pieces of national-security journalism. The former is a deeply reported and morally outraged dive into the bureaucratic grind of the national-security state after 9/11. The latter, also deeply reported, is a harbinger of where the US national-security state is headed next: ambling deeper into cyberspace, which it barely understands, in search of digital monsters to destroy. </p> <p><em><strong>Spencer Ackerman, national security editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman\">@attackerman</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>If watching the film without reading the book makes you look dumb, how stupid do you need to be to have watched two films without having read the book? <a href=\"http://www.pajiba.com/book_reviews/let-the-right-one-in-book-review.php\"><strong>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s </strong><strong>novel</strong><strong> Let the Right One In </strong></a>spawned two movies: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review\">the Swedish original</a> (great) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/04/let-me-in-film-review\">an American remake</a> (not nearly as bad as people say). I watched both, and when I came across the book in a secondhand shop I thought I should complete the trilogy. It was a great decision. Lindqvist manages to be both funny and scary while coming up with the slightest excuse to quote Morrissey. And if there’s one thing vampire novels need more of, it’s Morrissey.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Tom Lutz, sports editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz\">@tom_lutz</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Lawrence in Arabia, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/lawrence-arabia-modern-middle-east-review\"><strong>Scott Anderson</strong>’s biography of TE Lawrence</a>, was a cracker, and essential to understanding the rise of the Islamic State this year.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Roberts, Washington bureau chief (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan\">@RobertsDan</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>My favorite book this year has been <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/create-perfect-wife-wendy-moore-review\">Wendy Moore’s How to Create the Perfect Wife</a></strong>, which thankfully is not an actual DIY guide. Instead, it’s a lively, novelistic look at a somewhat misogynistic member of the Victorian A-list of intellectuals who had such a terrible way with women that he spirited away two orphans, with the intent of training them to make his perfect wife. With cameos by a frowning Erasmus Darwin, George Sand and Henry James, it’s a little education in history as well as a beautifully written profile of a social experiment gone bad. </p> <p><em><strong>Heidi Moore, US finance and economics editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn\">@moorehn</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Twenty-fourteen has indisputably been the year of <strong>Roxane Gay</strong>, and while the conversation has been dominated by the August release of Bad Feminist, her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-interview\"><strong>An Untamed State</strong></a> kicked off her reign.

Beukes deserves perpetual praise for showing how to tell a complex crime story without glorifying the killer. </p> <p><em><strong>Amanda Holpuch, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/holpuch\">@holpuch</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465069996\">The Lonely War</a> by Nazila Fathi </strong>is a vivid and compelling memoir by the former New York Times correspondent in Tehran, who was forced into exile when government forces made threats to her life in the wake of her reporting on the Green Movement protests in 2009. Fathi recounts in exquisite detail three decades in pre and post-1979 Iran – revealing the inherent contradictions at the heart of life after the revolution. </p> <p><em><strong>Raya Jalabi, copy editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rayajalabi\">@rayajalabi</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://davidsreynolds.com/?page_id=170\">Walt Whitman’s America: a Cultural Biography by David S Reynolds</a></strong> is all-enveloping on the man, his art, his century and his country.

A tremendous work of history.</p> <p>Honorable mention: <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Lucky-Bastard-Tales-Tinseltown/dp/1493007971\">One Lucky Bastard: Tales from Tinseltown by Sir Roger Moore</a></strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Martin Pengelly, weekend editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly\">@MartinPengelly</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/alice-goffmans-on-the-run.html?_r=0\"><strong>On the Run by Alice Goffman</strong></a> is an unbelievably good ethnography about urban poor and their relationship with criminal justice in Philly that has become pertinent in light of Eric Garner/Michael Brown. </p> <p><em><strong>Paul Lewis, Washington correspondent (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulLewis\">@PaulLewis</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I was living in Australia for the first six months of the year and felt duty-bound to read <strong>Christos Tsiolkas</strong>’s latest book <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review\">Barracuda</a></strong>. I opened it expecting to hate-read it but immediately got pulled in. Angry, clever and compelling, it tells the story of Danny, the son of working class Greek immigrants whose talent as a swimmer puts him in a posh public school, with results as painful and inexorable as a belly flop from a diving board.</p> <p><em><strong>Alex Needham, arts editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexneedham74\">@alexneedham74</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I started reading <strong>Michael Azzerad</strong>’s <strong><a href=\"http://\">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a> </strong>in January, while listening to a load of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/oct/01/1\">Alistair Cooke’s Letter From America</a> that covered the same period. It was a great combination of amazing lucid storytelling from the world of underground rock and fairly straight-laced tales of Reagan’s presidency. The two somehow dovetailed together quite neatly especially when the Minutemen sang about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/usa.duncancampbell\">Iran-Contra</a> or Minor Threat reminisced about surviving on Reagan’s “government cheese”.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanre Bakare, commissioning editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanre_bakare\">@Lanre_Bakare</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>The best book I’ve read this year so far – and by far – was<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/one-summer-1927-bill-bryson-review\"> One Summer: America, 1927 by Bill Bryson</a></strong>.

This October, on vacation in Hawaii, I started reading a book about the beach – Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon – on a beach, before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice\"> the movie</a> came out, and then my vacation was over and now the movie is out and here I am reading something else on my iPhone and there is that book over there, dog-eared to page 183 and dust-gathering forevermore. The best book I read this year was the only book I read this year, and I didn’t even finish it.

turn over new leaf as celebrity memoirs slip out of booksellers’ top 10","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-23T22:21:48Z","fields":{"wordcount":"961","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44e5c","body":"<p>It used to be that for a guaranteed boost to sales, all publishers needed to do was sign up a celebrity, get a book out of them – by their own hand or not – put it in the shops and watch the cash roll in.</p> <p>But new figures show that perhaps Britain is falling out of love with the celebrity memoir, with few of the genre making the top 10 chart despite new offerings from the comedy stalwarts Stephen Fry, John Cleese, Graham Norton and Paul Merton.</p> <p>Only the memoir of Lynda Bellingham, the “Oxo mum” and Loose Woman who died of cancer in October this year, has made it into the top five. Her book, Something I’ve Been Dying to Tell You, sold 37,118 copies, according to sales monitors Nielsen Book, making it to No 4 in the chart.</p> <p>The memoir of the British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – a hero of the Isle of Man TT races who has carved a television career often based on his engineering skills – is the only other celebrity title to make the top 10, selling 31,931 and securing ninth place.</p> <p>A report in the Bookseller magazine said sales of biographies and autobiographies had fallen by almost 4% this year. Earlier this month Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, revealed he had cut back on buying up stars as non-fiction celebrity titles proved risky when publishers had to pay a big advance on a title that could turn out to be unprofitable with a short shelf life. “We’re moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” he said.</p> <p>“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to backlist [continue to sell] well.”</p> <p>The other Christmas staple buy – the cookbook – has also fared less well this year. Although Jamie Oliver has topped the Christmas charts multiple times with previous offerings, this year’s outing, Jamie’s Comfort Food, proved less appetising to readers, with a Christmas week sale of 33,309 copies putting it in seventh place in the chart. Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever Dishes was 10th.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin at independent book chain Foyles said: “I think inevitably we can’t keep selling celebrity autobiographies and cookbooks, and big-name fiction, as the things we push every year. Eventually people are bored of it and look for something else. This has been a terrific year for books across the board.”</p> <p>This year’s bestseller is the Guinness World Records account of everything from how far a dog can ride a scooter to the world’s tallest man – still Robert Wadlow, who was measured at 272cm (8ft 11.1ins) in 1940 – with sales of 58,477 copies in the week to 20 December. It is the first time it has headed the Christmas charts since 2002.</p> <p>In second place – with a gap of more than 15,000 copies – came David Walliams’s Awful Auntie, with sales of 42,695. “Do you have an awful auntie?” Walliams opens his hit children’s story. “Perhaps your aunt demands you wear that horrendously itchy jumper she knitted for you at Christmas? The one which reads ‘I Love My Auntie’ in huge purple letters on the front? However awful your auntie might be, she will never be in the same league of awfulness as Aunt Alberta.”</p> <p>Jeff Kinney’s latest Wimpy Kid offering, The Long Haul, in which “middle-school weakling” Greg Heffley and his family take a road trip, came in a narrow third, with sales of 42,279 copies.</p> <p>“I think it has been a very strong year for young adult and kids’ fiction. And it’s a good signal that books remain an excellent Christmas gift,” said Nielsen’s Andre Breedt. “That’s the story of Guinness – it shows books are still an exciting Christmas present.”</p> <p>Zoe Sugg’s debut novel, Girl Online, takes the fifth-place slot. Sugg, who has more than five million subscribers on YouTube for her fashion and beauty video blogs, ran into some controversy earlier this month when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/11/zoella-ghostwriter-sioban-curham-controversy-childrens-author\" title=\"\">her novel had been ghostwritten</a>, but the drama does not appear to have affected sales, with Girl Online – about a teenage blogger – selling 34,787 copies.</p> <p>Outside the top five, the top 10 is rounded out by Gillian Flynn’s thriller smash Gone Girl and Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill.</p> <p>“The big surprise this Christmas has been Guy Martin. This is the bestselling autobiography of the year and has been the bestselling non-fiction title for Waterstones so far in December – an astonishing achievement for a title that is eight months old and from a figure who is not as widely known as some of the celebrities with books out this autumn,” said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones’ non-fiction buyer.</p> <p>Foyles’ top 10 ranged from astronaut Chris Hadfield’s You Are Here to Japanese novel The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, with just one memoir, neurosurgeon Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm, in the lineup.</p> <p>At Waterstones, the Private Eye Annual was the chain’s Christmas No 1, followed by Martin’s autobiography, Jessie Burton’s debut novel, The Miniaturist, and Girl Online.</p> <h2><strong>Nielsen book chart for Christmas week </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 </strong>Guinness World Records 2015 58,477</p> <p><strong>2 </strong>Awful Auntie, David Walliams 42,695</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>The Long Haul: Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jeff Kinney 42,279</p> <p><strong>4 </strong>There’s Something I’ve Been Dying To Tell You, Lynda Bellingham 37,118</p> <p><strong>5 </strong>Girl Online, Zoe Sugg 34,787</p> <p><strong>6 </strong>Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn 34,222</p> <p><strong>7 </strong>Jamie’s Comfort Food, Jamie Oliver 33,309</p> <p><strong>8 </strong>Churchill Factor, Boris Johnson 32,625</p> <p><strong>9 </strong>Guy Martin: My Autobiography 31,931</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Best Ever Dishes, Tom Kerridge 26,481</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again","headline":"Readers turn over new leaf as celebrity memoirs slip out of booksellers’ top 10","byline":"Alison Flood and Caroline Davies \r\n","commentable":"true","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-26T22:21:48Z","standfirst":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/23/readers-turn-over-new-leaf-celebrity-memoirs-slip-out-booksellers-top-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/23/readers-turn-over-new-leaf-celebrity-memoirs-slip-out-booksellers-top-10","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"9624f45ad9203a806bd322d4dc996862d4ea7537","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419373212944/Only-the-memoir-of-Oxo-mu-011.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*49095210","altText":"Only the memoir of 'Oxo mum' Lynda Bellingham and motorcycle racer Guy Martin have made it into the ","caption":"Only the memoir of ‘Oxo mum’ Lynda Bellingham and motorcycle racer Guy Martin have made it into the Nielsen Book top 10 this Christmas.

James remembered by Richard Coles","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-21T09:00:10Z","fields":{"wordcount":"514","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","body":"<p><strong>While studying for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Yorkshire, the Reverend Richard Coles chaperoned the crime writer on one of her visits there.</strong></p> <p>“Call me Phyllis! While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative.

Townsend remembered by Nicci Gerrard","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-21T09:00:10Z","fields":{"wordcount":"715","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4488n","body":"<p>Until I met Sue Townsend, I hadn’t realised it was possible to be hilarious, angry, scathing, sad, kind, self-mocking, solitary, gregarious and loveable all at the same time, in one breath gathering up a tumult of emotions and ideas. When she went blind, she talked to me about it with extraordinary humour (how she chatted to the coat hanging on the back of the door, mistaking it for her husband, Colin, threw gloves onto the compost heap instead of potato peelings, made a fine debut with her white stick) and yet managed to convey her loss and horror. Life had always bashed her about and she had always refused to be defeated by it. She was one of the most generous-hearted women I’d ever encountered, living life full-throttle, and yet somehow she remained mysterious, protecting her secret self, the self that wrote and dreamed.</p> <p>I visited her a couple of times in her Leicester home – a house crammed with objects, paintings on every wall, flowers in jugs, plants in pots, bowls and cups and knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac everywhere, photographs of her family whose faces she could no longer see and messages she couldn’t read pinned onto the noticeboards, books she could no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor. After she died, I went back to the house to talk to her family (I’m trained as a humanist celebrant and I conducted her funeral). It was very strange to be in her home – the house that Sue built – without her in it, sitting at the table, exuberant, life-filled, at the heart of things. The place was still full of objects (she was no minimalist) and full of people too, passionately bereft. Her husband, Colin, was there, and her four children and their partners, and also most of her grandchildren – her notion of family was broad and inclusive; home was always a place of welcome. They talked over each other, interrupted and added to each other, all wanting to share their versions of the many-sided Sue Townsend.</p> <p>She was the young girl who’d not learnt to read until eight and left her secondary modern at 15, but who’d devoured Russian, French and American literature and who was never without a book; the tree-climber (she would sit and read in the branches); the beatnik dressed in black; the single mother who had many jobs and no money but who made a feast out of Oxo cubes and tinned peas. She was the wife – Colin recalled their first meeting, when she’d seen him shepherding geese across the road and thought he was a nutter; their first date, when they’d taken her children skating; their holidays together. She was the grandmother, who never locked her door so that the grandchildren could come and go as they pleased and who let them dress up in her finest clothes and tear round the muddy garden. (Her boundless hospitality meant that sometimes there was no room for her and she had to book herself into the hotel down the road to get her books written.) She was the radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-welfare\" title=\"\">who believed in social justice</a> and had 20 or so flying picket miners staying with them during the strike, who took her daughter to Greenham Common, who never let fame and fortune go to her head, who remained a woman of the people. She was the chain smoker, the world’s worst diabetic. The cafe-moocher, partygoer, late-nighter, mahjong player, vodka drinker, Chanel-No-5 and red-lipstick wearer (she would even put lipstick on to have a phone conversation), the beetroot and violet-cream devourer. She was the writer, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/11/adrian-moles-best-quotes-what-are-your-favourites\" title=\"\">Adrian Mole diaries </a>entered the national consciousness and who wrote about lives of quiet desperation and made them funny, even poetic. She was the dreamer.</p> <p>As her family shared their memories with me and with each other, as they talked, laughed and wept, what emerged was a woman whose generosity was almost reckless. And yet, in the midst of the warmth and chaos, Sue Townsend maintained her inviolable secret self – her writing self. And although she’s gone, although that house no longer has its centre, that self remains. Open any of her books and there she is: the unbeatable, unmistakeable, irreplaceable, unforgettable Sue.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>Nicci Gerrard</strong>, who conducted the
